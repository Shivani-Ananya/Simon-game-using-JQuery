# Simon-game-using-JQuery
hi all, as my recent learning of jQuery, i have created a game which is similar to Simon game. Its a total brain game, engaging the user to follow the leads. 
It starts with any operation of input key. 
the user must follow the sound/box flicker and continue with the previous ones.
engaging game to play when bored and also develop your IQ while playing. 
it was fun and also exciting to build such projects
